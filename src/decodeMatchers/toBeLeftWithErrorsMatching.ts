       * @summary
       * Used to check that the value is a Left Validation which contains an array of
       * ValidationErrors that, when processed by `PathReporter.report()`,  match an array of
       * supplied strings or regular expressions.
       *
       * @description
       * An io-ts type codec `decode()` method will return a Left with an array of `ValidationError`
       * objects if the supplied value can not be successfully validated and decoded to the
       * specified io-ts type.
       *
       * For codecs that are composed from multiple codecs, multiple errors may be returned as each
       * sub-codec is applied to the values it is charged with validating.
       *
       * This matcher provides an easy way to check if expected validation errors are present. To do
       * this, it makes use of the io-ts PathReporter module.
       *
       * To use this matcher, supply an array of strings that you expect to be present in the array
       * of strings returned by `PathReporter.report()`. You can supply either regular expressions
       * or substrings. The matcher will try to match each array entry against each entry in the
       * array of `PathReporter.report()` strings.
       *
       * If the supplied object is not a Left that contains an array of ValidationErrors, or if any
       * of the strings you supply cannot be matched to one of the ValidationErrors, the matcher
       * will return `false`. If all of the strings you supply are matched, it will return `true`.
       *
       * Note: This matcher supports the current (stable) io-ts interface. There is a new
       * experimental io-ts decoder interface that returns `Either<DecodeError, A>` results instead.
       * This matcher does not support that interface.
       *
       * @examples
       * ```typescript
       *  import * as t from 'io-ts';
       *  import { PathReporter } from 'io-ts/lib/PathReporter';
       *
       *  const Name = t.type({first: t.string, last: t.string});
       *  type Name = t.TypeOf<typeof Name>;
       *
       *  const receivedName = {first: 1, last: undefined};
       *  const validation = Name.decode(receivedName);
       *
       *  test('The number 1 and the value undefined are invalid values for the t.string codec', () => {
       *    expect(validation).toBeLeftWithErrorsMatching(['1', /undefined/]);
       *  });
       *
       *  const errorStrings = PathReporter.report(validation);
       *
       *  test('PathReporter and standard jest matchers can be used instead if you prefer', () => {
       *    expect(errorStrings).toEqual(
       *      expect.arrayContaining([expect.stringMatching('1'), expect.stringMatching(/undefined/)]),
       *    );
       *  });

       *    // Using `@relmify/jest-serializer-strip-ansi` and `jest-snapshot-serializer-raw`
